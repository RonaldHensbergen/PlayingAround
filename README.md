#Playing Around Repository

This repository is meant for some fun projects I did, just because I liked doing it. Or at least I saved it because I liked it. Below I explain each file.

####Sierpinski.R
As a math student I took on an assignment called the Life Game. The rules to this game were:
1. Draw 3 points on a piece of paper in a triangular shape, called A, B and C
2. Draw a different 4th point on this piece of paper, called Z
3. Now throw a 3-sided honest dice. If the dice results in 1, then choose point A, 2 then B, 3 then C.
4. Now draw a new point Z that's in the middle of the chosen point and the previous Z.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 an infinite number of times.

What shape will be the final result?

Task was to resolve this in a computer program of choice, or purely theoretical. Back in the days, I decided for a solution in Excel, and also played around with some variables. Just recently I added some more variables (number of points, etc).

Just now I also resolved this in R, since I'm busy studying this and this is the result. Later I might add the number of points also.
